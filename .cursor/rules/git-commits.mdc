# Git Commit Rules

## No Co-Author Attribution

NEVER include "Co-authored-by" or any co-author attribution in commit messages.

```
# BAD - Never do this
git commit -m "Fix bug

Co-authored-by: Someone <email>"

# GOOD - Clean commit message
git commit -m "Fix bug"
```

Keep commit messages clean and focused on describing the changes only.
